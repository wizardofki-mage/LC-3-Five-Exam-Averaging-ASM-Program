## General info
A program written in LC-3 assembly language for averaging five exam scores and displaying the minimum, maximum, average, and their corresponding letter grade.
This is the course group project for CIS-11: Computer Architecture and Organization at Moreno Valley College, taught by Dr. Kasey Nguyen, PhD.

## Technologies:
- LC-3 assembly language and the LC-3 editor and simulator (see below):

## Setup
Running the .asm assembly language file requires the LC-3 (Little Computer 3) Simulator created by Yale N. Patt and Sanjay J. Patel.
It can be downloaded at https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html
1. Open the .asm file in LC3Edit.exe (version 3.0.0.0)
2. Click on Translate --> Assemble.
3. This will create .obj and other associated files.
4. Open the Simulate.exe program (version 3.01.0)
5. Make sure the console window is visible in addition to the simulator, because often the console window opens minimized or behind other windows when launching the simulator.
6. If you had a previous program running in the simulator, click on File --> Reinitialize Machine to reset it to default values.
7. Click on File --> Load Program and choose the .obj file created by the assembler in LC3edit.
8. Click on Execute --> Run

## Usage
After running the program, enter five test scores between 0 and 100 separated by the Enter key. The minimum, average, and maximum test scores will display in the console with their corresponding letter grade next to them.
(i.e. the standard grading scale: < 60 = F, 60 - 69 = D, 70-79 = C, 80-89 = B, and 90 - 100 = A).

## Minimum hardware requirements
- Although Patt and Patel do not mention which versions of Windows to use with their LC-3 Simulator, the program was developed using these tools running on Windows 10 without any issues.
- Any computer with sufficient processing power, RAM, a monitor made within the past 15-20 years, and an Internet connection to download the .asm file and the LC-3 Simulator should suffice.
