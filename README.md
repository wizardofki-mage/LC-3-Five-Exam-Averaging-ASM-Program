# LC-3-Five-Exam-Averaging-ASM-Program
A program written in LC-3 assembly language for averaging five exam scores and displaying the minimum, maximum, average, and their corresponding letter grade.
This is the course group project for CIS-11: Computer Architecture and Organization.
Running the assembly language file requires the LC-3 Simulator (Little Computer 3) developed by Yale N. Patt and Sanjay J. Patel that can be downloaded at https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html
1. Open the .asm file in LC3Edit.exe
2. Click on Translate --> Assemble.
3. This will create .obj and other associated files.
4. Open the Simulate.exe program.
5. Make sure the console window is visible in addition to the simulator, because often the console window opens minimized or behind other windows when launching the simulator.
6. If you had a previous program running in the simulator, click on File --> Reinitialize Machine to reset it to default values.
7. Click on File --> Load Program and choose the .obj file created by the assembler in LC3edit.
8. Click on Execute --> Run
